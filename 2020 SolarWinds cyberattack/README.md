# Attack Template


The attack description can take many forms, but should ideally include: 
- Who was attacked and when
- The negative impact of the attack
- The attack agent, when it is known
- A categorisation in the STRIDE model
- CVS vulnerabilities when known
- What measure have been put in place as a result of the attack. 

Sources should be referenced and quoted appropriately.
