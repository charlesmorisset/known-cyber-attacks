# Feedback on 22/10/22

* Good attack description, going in depth on some of the aspects.
* Some parts can be a bit confusing, e.g., the mention that the vulnerability is unknown, and then later on a discussion about CVE-2013-0632. Although it's 
good to have a reflection on the possible vulnerability, it would be better to keep the narrative simple and focused on the current attack. 
* Interesing reflection on the possible consequences of the attack as part of STRIDE, but the STRIDE categorisation needs to focus on what happened with the attack, 
rather than what was enabled by the attack. 
* Very nice discussion about what was done after
* Excellent usage of references.
