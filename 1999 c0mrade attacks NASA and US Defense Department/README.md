# 1999 c0mrade attacks NASA and US Defense Department

--------------------------------

### Overview
In 1999, a fifteen-year-old Floridian named Jonathan James gained access to highly confidential computers at NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. Specifically, he penetrated the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). James' hacking career started with his own school district, but he quickly shifted his aims for more high profile targets.

James' entry to the DTRA was discovered because he made no effort to cover his tracks. James said he did not consider what he was doing to be wrong and that he was just "playing around," so he did not bother to make an effort to conceal what he had done.

### Impact

James gained remote access to thirteen computers at the Marshall Space Flight Center from 28 June to 29 June 1999. In these two days he accessed confidential data as well as NASA proprietary software, which he promptly downloaded for himself. This software supported the physical environment of the International Space Station and was worth 1.7 million U.S. Dollars. James alleged the government was overpaying for the poor quality code he found in this software.

To address this threat NASA shut down its computers for three weeks -- costing an estimated $41000.

James' attack on the DTRA spanned from 23 August to 27 October 1999. James was able to install a backdoor on a computer server associated with the DTRA. He then installed a packet sniffer to intercept communications. James intercepted more than 3000 messages from DTRA employees and learned nineteen distinct usernames and passwords. This gained him access to ten military computers in use by the Pentagon.

James was the first ever juvenile hacker sentenced to prison time in the United States.

### Categorization

**Spoofing**: 
James stole 19 username/password combinations from the DTRA. Ten of these belonged to computers on a Pentagon weapons system.

**Information Disclosure**: 
James accessed and downloaded confidential military communications and NASA proprietary  software.

**Denial of Service**: 
James' attack on NASA forced them to shut off the computers affected for three weeks and cost them an alleged $41000.
