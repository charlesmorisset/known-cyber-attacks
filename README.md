# Known Cyber Attacks

This repository contains the description of known cyber attacks. Contributions are welcome from all students from Newcastle and Durham. 

To add the description of an attack, follow the [standard instructions to contribute to a project](https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312): 
- create a new folder with the relevant attack name
- add a README.md file in this folder containing the description of the attack using [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). 

A [template](Template/README.md) has been created to show an example of the file structure.
